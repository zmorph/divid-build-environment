# cura-build-environment

**WIP**

This repository contains helper scripts for building Cura from source. It will create a base environment from which
which are used to build an installer for the specific OS.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.10.2
- conan >= 1.46

### Linux
- GCC >= 8.0
- CMake >= 3.16
- GNU Make >= 4
- Docker >= 20

### MacOS
- MacOS SDK 
- clang-apple
- MacOS

### Windows
- Visual Studio >= 16
- NMake
- Docker
- makensis (should be on the PATH)
- jinja2 (should be parth of Conan)

  - twisted-iocpsupport
  - typed-ast
  - typing-extensions
  - urllib3

  - wheel
  - zeroconf
  - zipp
  - zope.interface

The list of dependencies above also have their own dependencies, such as:

- cpython
- protobuf
- clipper
- boost
- gtest
- nlopt

These can be installed with the help of [Conan](https://conan.io/), which is a dependency manager for C++ projects.
It will either download the binaries and header files or compile it automatically from source. It will also generate
the CMake find_package modules, such that these can be used. The `conanfile.txt` located in the root of this directory
specifies a list of used dependencies.

Installation of Conan is simple:

```bash
pip install conan
```

> Ultimaker has its own standard Conan configuration, you could apply these with the command below. Keep in mind that
> this isn't necesarry and it might overwrite your current Conan configuration
> ```bash
> conan config install https://github.com/ultimaker/conan-config.git
> ```

Once Conan is installed and configured, installing the cura-build-environment is easy. The steps below should do the
trick.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<install_path> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_path> ..
cmake --build .
```

The Installer for your OS can now be found in the `<install_path>/installer/dist/`

> On Windows make sure you are working in the x64 Visual Studio 2019/2022 Command Prompt and specify the NMake generator using the
> `cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<install_path> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_path> ..`

> If you want to see all the options available use a tool such as `ccmake` or `cmake-gui`
